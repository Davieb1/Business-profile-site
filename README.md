# Empowering Fitness Businesses Website

This project is a dual-purpose website that promotes web development services tailored to fitness professionals, as well as fitness web development services offered by Davie Birrell. The goal of this website is to offer visitors a clear path to either explore web development services or fitness websites focused on personal trainers who have an online business or offer fitness challenges or offer a hybrid approach to training either online or in a gym environment, all within a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design.

Features

- Sticky Navigation Bar: Includes links to key sections of the site with a call-to-action (CTA) button, "Get a Consultation," that is positioned on the right side of the nav bar.
- Hero Section: Features a central image of Davie Birrell with a tagline to introduce the site's purpose and a brief description on the right side.
- Split Section: A split-screen section allowing users to choose between exploring web development services (with a coding-themed background) or fitness coaching (with an image of Davie Birrell in a group exercise session). Each section includes a CTA button under the headings.
- Footer: Contains social media links (Facebook, Instagram, and GitHub) styled with their respective brand colors. The icons scale on hover for an interactive feel.

Technology Stack
The website is built using:

- HTML5: For structuring the content and layout of the site.
- CSS3: For styling the components, including layout design, hover effects, and responsiveness.
- Font Awesome: Used for social media icons in the footer.
